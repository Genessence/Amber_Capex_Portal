# Capex Amber — User Stories

**Last updated:** 2026-07-16

Living backlog for product requirements. The AI agent maintains this file across chats whenever you describe or change a user story.

## How to add stories

Tell the agent in plain language, e.g. *"As a buyer, I want to filter requests by plant so I only see my site."* The agent will append or update an entry here with acceptance criteria and status.

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Status** | `backlog` · `in_progress` · `done` · `cancelled` |
| **Priority** | `must` · `should` · `could` |

---

## Epics (baseline — implemented)

These reflect the current app as documented in `CLAUDE.md`. Mark individual stories `done` unless you ask to change them.

### Epic: Authentication & roles

| ID | Story | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-001 | As an internal user, I want to pick a role on login so I can use the portal with the right permissions. | done |
| US-002 | As an internal user, I want to switch roles from the top nav so I can demo different personas without re-logging in. | done |
| US-003 | As a plant-scoped buyer or plant head, I want data filtered to my plant so I only see relevant requests. | done |

### Epic: CAPEX request lifecycle

| ID | Story | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-010 | As a buyer, I want to create a multi-line CAPEX request in a spreadsheet-style grid so I can submit several items in one request. | done |
| US-011 | As a buyer, I want sourcing engineer auto-assigned on submit so I do not have to choose one manually. | done |
| US-012 | As a plant head, I want to approve or reject requests pending my approval so high-value spend is controlled. | done |
| US-013 | As a sourcing member, I want to invite vendors and compare quotes so I can run the sourcing workflow. | done |
| US-014 | As a supplier, I want to open a tokenised link and submit a quote so I can respond without an account. | done |
| US-015 | As a buyer, I want to see request status history so I can audit who moved a request and when. | done |

### Epic: Budget & master data

| ID | Story | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-020 | As a plant head or admin, I want a CAPEX master budget grid per plant and FY so planned spend is visible. | done |
| US-021 | As a plant head or admin, I want to clone master data into a new fiscal year so I do not re-enter everything. | done |
| US-022 | As an admin, I want custom budget heads and plants so the master reflects our organisation. | done |

### Epic: Administration

| ID | Story | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-030 | As a super admin, I want a settings page to manage configuration so I can maintain the demo environment. | done |
| US-031 | As a super admin, I want to reset all local data so I can restart a demo from seed data. | done |

## Active backlog

### Epic: Brown Field procurement expansion (US-057 – US-063)

Full Brown-Field fulfillment lifecycle. **All scoped to `fieldType === 'brown_field'`** unless noted; Green Field / Digitisation / IT flows unchanged. Frontend-only (localStorage). Decisions captured with the user on 2026-06-19.

### US-057 — Maintenance & Accounts roles
- **As** Amber, **I want** a global Maintenance user (budget authoring) and a global Accounts user (FA codes, PO, payments) **so that** the new workflow has the right personas.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] `maintenance` and `accounts` are **global** roles (not plant-scoped), registered in `ROLE_NAMES`, `Sidebar` (`ROLE_META` + `NAV`), `TopNav` (`ROLE_GROUPS`), and login `ROLES`
  - [x] Maintenance can open CAPEX Master + Budget Planning; Accounts can open the Accounts Queue
- **Files:** `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/TopNav.tsx`, `src/app/login/page.tsx`

### US-058 — Next-FY budget proposal, bulk upload & admin approval
- **As a** maintenance user, **I want** to author a next-FY Brown Field budget (with bulk Excel/CSV upload) that an admin approves and publishes as the new live FY **so that** buyers get the updated budget.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Live Brown Field FY master is **read-only**; budget changes flow through a next-FY proposal (the only mid-FY change is an Adhoc transfer)
  - [x] `/capex/budget-proposals` authoring: seed from live FY, edit rows, **bulk upload** (Excel/CSV) with template download, submit for approval
  - [x] `/capex/budget-approvals` (super_admin): full head → sub-particular breakdown of the proposal (no live-FY diff / delta columns); Approve **publishes** as a new live FY; Reject; double-publish guarded
  - [x] New requests pick up the published FY via field-scoped `getLatestMasterFyForField` (Green/Digitisation/IT FY unaffected)
- **Files:** `src/lib/budgetProposalUtils.ts`, `src/lib/bulkMasterImport.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/budget-proposals/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/budget-approvals/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/master/page.tsx`

### US-059 — Brown Field request without buyer quotations
- **As a** buyer, **I want** to submit a Brown Field request with only specs + a preferred vendor (no quotations) **so that** sourcing owns pricing.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Brown Field new-request shows a preferred-vendor + est-budget block instead of the per-line quote panel; the **Description** field is the spec (no separate Specifications field)
  - [x] Line budget derives from est. budget or the linked master allocation; no `VendorInvite` seeding for Brown Field
  - [x] Other field types keep the buyer-quote flow unchanged
- **Files:** `src/app/(internal)/capex/new/page.tsx`

### US-060 — RFQ vs Reverse Auction + RFQ price flow (vendor-quotes-first)
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** vendors to submit their quotation first, then negotiate inline or escalate to a reverse auction before requesting a Proforma Invoice **so that** RFQ works the way a real Request-for-Quotation does.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Brown Field at `sourcing` chooses `sourcingMode` (`rfq` | `auction`); a "Change method" control reverts to the chooser before a PI is requested (invited vendors kept)
  - [x] **Vendor quotes first, per line item:** inviting a vendor sends the link and sets `awaiting_quote`; the vendor enters a **unit price per line item** (+ freight/packing/service/delivery/warranty/currency) on a responsive, auction-styled portal table → `pending_sourcing`. `RfqQuote` carries `linePrices` + base subtotal `price`
  - [x] Sourcing **counters inline in the comparison grid** (per-line unit prices, one vendor column at a time) → `pending_vendor`, or **accepts** the vendor's quote directly; the vendor accepts/counters/declines on the portal; either side accepting → `approved`; `reopenRfqQuote` re-opens an approved quote; `proposeRfqQuote` sanitizes input and `respondToRfqQuote` is turn-guarded
  - [x] RFQ comparison is the **reverse-auction grid** (modeled on `VendorGrid`): line items as rows (Item/Description/Qty), vendors as columns with per-line unit price + line total and a green "↓ Lowest" highlight, footer attribute rows, Grand Total row with L1, and a per-line **Final Decision** column **identical to the auction's** (Price ₹ / Disc % / Vendor / Price×Qty, persisted in `request.sourcingDecision`); stacked cards below `lg`; collapsible read-only thread. **Copy supplier link** is available on every vendor in every status. Accept finalizes one vendor for the single-vendor PI
  - [x] **Start Reverse Auction** carries each vendor's RFQ prices into the auction as opening bids (`seedAuctionFromRfq` → seeded `Quote` with per-line `itemPrices`); lowest = **L1**, others rebid lower; threshold also pre-fills to the lowest RFQ grand total
  - [x] A **"Start Reverse Auction"** action escalates to the existing auction flow with the threshold pre-filled to the lowest collected grand total (`lowestRfqTotal`, editable)
  - [x] After the quotation **and** documents are approved, sourcing requests a PI (`pi_requested`); vendor uploads PI (`pi_submitted`) which reaches buyer + accounts
- **Files:** `src/lib/rfqUtils.ts`, `src/lib/auctionTheme.ts`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`

### US-061 — Document approval package (PBG + DLC + one-time terms)
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** vendors to approve a Performance Bank Guarantee and Delay Liability Clause (plus payment terms for one-time vendors) **so that** terms are agreed before fulfillment — in both RFQ and auction flows.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] One-time / not-onboarded vendor flag on the vendor (onboard modal) with payment terms + splits; onboarded vendors carry fetched (mocked) terms
  - [x] In RFQ the package (Commercial Terms + PBG + DLC) is **decoupled from the price** and **auto-sends the moment the price is agreed** (`respondToRfqQuote` on approve → `docApprovalStatus: 'pending'`); the vendor reviews and approves the documents on a **separate** screen (`respondToDocApproval`); PI gated on **both** price and documents approved (`canRequestPi`). Declining the documents shows a "Terms Declined" state; sourcing can re-send (`resendDocApprovalPackage`); re-opening/countering an approved quote resets the documents
  - [x] Auction embeds Commercial Terms + PBG/DLC on the approval document (print view + supplier screen); one-time payment terms shown; all agreed by accepting participation
- **Files:** `src/lib/docPackageUtils.ts`, `src/components/DocPackageReview.tsx`, `src/components/VendorOnboardModal.tsx`, `src/lib/auctionDocumentUtils.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`

### US-062 — Accounts (FA codes + PO), milestone payments & TAT
- **As an** accounts user, **I want** to assign FA codes, raise a PO, and record milestone payments (advance/dispatch/installation), with a delay-liability TAT clock **so that** fulfillment and penalties are tracked.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] `/accounts/queue` lists requests in fulfillment; `AccountsPanel` on request detail
  - [x] FA code per line; PO build + submit; payment milestones from the vendor's split with per-term checkboxes; ticking notifies the vendor (toast + supplier card)
  - [x] TAT starts PI + 1 week; **0.5%/week to a cumulative 5%, then 5%/week**; final payment stops the clock and completes the request
  - [x] Sourcing or accounts can record payments; both RFQ and auction winners converge into this chain
- **Files:** `src/lib/paymentUtils.ts`, `src/lib/tatUtils.ts`, `src/components/AccountsPanel.tsx`, `src/components/TatBanner.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/accounts/queue/page.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`

### US-064 — Accounts split: Plant Accounts (FA) → Global Accounts (PO upload + payments)
- **As an** accounts organisation, **I want** Plant Accounts to assign FA codes and Global Accounts to issue the PO (with an uploaded PO document the vendor receives) **so that** FA coding and PO issuance are separated and the vendor gets the official PO.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] New `plant_accounts` role (single, global) registered everywhere; `accounts` relabelled **Global Accounts**; `/accounts/queue` open to both
  - [x] `pi_submitted` → Plant Accounts assigns FA codes + **Submit FA codes** (`submitFaCodes` → `accounts_processing`) → Global Accounts assigns **PO number** + **uploads PO doc** + **Issue PO** (`issuePurchaseOrder` → `payment_in_progress`, `issuedAt`)
  - [x] Vendor is notified and sees/downloads the PO on the supplier portal (**Purchase Order card**); PO-doc base64 stored in IndexedDB
  - [x] Payment milestones unchanged after PO issue; final tick → `completed`
- **Files:** `src/components/AccountsPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`, `src/components/TopNav.tsx`, `src/app/login/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/accounts/queue/page.tsx`

### US-065 — Brown Field is RFQ-only; auction needs ≥2 quotes
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** every Brown Field request to run RFQ (no direct-auction option) and only escalate to a reverse auction once **≥2 vendors have quoted** **so that** auctions are always competitive and preceded by an RFQ.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] The RFQ/Auction chooser + "Change method" are removed; `capex/[id]` auto-sets `sourcingMode:'rfq'` on entering `sourcing`
  - [x] "Start Reverse Auction" is enabled only when `invites.filter(i => i.rfqQuote).length >= 2` (hint when <2)
- **Files:** `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`

### US-066 — Item-wise GST via HSN code
- **As** sourcing, **I want** to set an HSN code per **line item** (not per vendor) so the correct GST is derived for each item identically across all vendors; **as a** vendor **I want** to see each item's HSN/GST.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done · **Updated:** 2026-07-14
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] HSN lives on `CapexLineItem.hsnCode` (item-wise, one value per item); **only the vendor enters it** (required per-line HSN dropdown in their bid table). **Sourcing sees it read-only** in the RFQ comparison grid (no dropdown) and cannot set/override it
  - [x] Supplier RFQ submission is **atomic**: `proposeRfqQuote(..., itemHsn?)` validates required HSN, writes the quote, and patches request line-item HSN in one pass (no separate `setLineHsn` loop). Cross-tab `storage` sync rehydrates **both** `requests` and `invites` so sourcing sees HSN + GST immediately
  - [x] The old whole-quote HSN dropdown is removed from the bid + counter forms; HSN is per line item only
  - [x] GST is per line = unit × qty × `gstRateForHsn(item.hsnCode)` (`rfqLineGstAmount`); footer charges (freight/packing/service) are **not** taxed
  - [x] Shared `rfqLineBreakdown` drives per-item display: HSN, GST rate, pre-GST subtotal, GST amount, and GST-inclusive line total on supplier + sourcing RFQ grids (desktop + mobile)
  - [x] `rfqGstAmount`/`rfqTotal`/`lowestRfqTotal` accept optional `items[]` and stay GST-inclusive → L1, threshold, auction seeding, PO amount unchanged; grid Grand Total shows an `incl. ₹X GST` subtitle per vendor
  - [x] `RfqQuote.hsnCode` kept only as a legacy fallback for old lump-sum quotes
- **Files:** `src/lib/hsnGst.ts`, `src/lib/rfqUtils.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/lib/paymentUtils.ts`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/components/supplier/SupplierQuoteTable.tsx`, `src/components/supplier/SupplierQuoteCards.tsx`

### US-067 — INCO Terms (Incoterms 2020) gate for new vendors
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** to invite any vendor by name/email/phone and require new/one-time vendors to agree a 12-question Incoterms document before they can quote **so that** delivery terms are settled up front.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Quick-add new vendor (name/email/phone) in the RFQ picker → one-time vendor (`inviteNewVendor`, `Vendor.contactPhone`)
  - [x] Foreign vendor answers the **12-question INCO Terms in a modal at quote submit** (`needsIncoTermsWithQuote`) — quote + terms persist atomically; two-sided edit-resend/accept/reject loop (`proposeIncoTerms`/`respondToIncoTerms`) until agreed; an unsettled agreement blocks the **award** (`incoTermsBlocksAward` → `canRequestPi`), not the quoting
- **Files:** `src/lib/incoTermsUtils.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`

### US-069 — Reverse auction converges to the PI flow exactly like RFQ
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** a reverse auction, once it ends and a winning vendor is finalized, to enter the **same** doc-package approval → Proforma-Invoice → Accounts (FA codes) → Global Accounts (PO) → payments flow as RFQ — with no extra buyer-approval detour — **so that** both sourcing paths behave identically from finalization onward.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done · **Updated:** 2026-06-26 (now mirrors RFQ's doc-package step + routing fix)
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] **Buyer step dropped:** finalizing the auction winner no longer routes to `sourcing_approved → buyer_approved`; sourcing finalizes (sets `finalVendorId` + `approveInvite`, status stays `sourcing`) then **Request Proforma Invoice** → `pi_requested`, mirroring RFQ
  - [x] **Finalize gated on auction-ended:** **Select as Final** / **✓ OK** in `VendorGrid` is disabled while the auction is live (`auctionLive = auctionConfig?.endsAt && !isAuctionExpired`); enabled once the countdown expires **or** sourcing clicks the new **Close Auction Now** button (`closeAuction` sets `endsAt` to now). No timed auction (seeded-quote comparison) ⇒ finalize stays available
  - [x] **Manual winner selection** (sourcing may override L1); the legacy direct-**Approve** back-door is also gated on `auctionLive`
  - [x] **Doc-package gate (mirrors RFQ):** finalizing the winner auto-sends the doc-package (`sendDocApprovalPackage` → `docApprovalStatus: 'pending'`); the winner approves it on the supplier portal (`AuctionWinnerTerms` → `DocPackageReview` → `respondToDocApproval`) before **Request Proforma Invoice** unlocks (gated on `effectiveDocApprovalStatus === 'approved'`). PBG/DLC are accepted twice (pre-auction Business Rules + here), but this confirms the per-vendor payment splits that drive milestones
  - [x] **Request PI restricted to `sourcing_head`/`super_admin`** (`canFinalize`) on **both** RFQ and auction; a `sourcing_member` runs the negotiation/auction but sees an "Awaiting sourcing head" note instead of the Request-PI action
  - [x] **Supplier routing fix:** the finalized vendor routes into the shared PI-upload/fulfillment view for `pi_requested` **as well as** the `FULFILLMENT_STATUSES` (`pi_requested` is not in that list, so it is matched explicitly) — without this an auction winner at `pi_requested` could never upload the PI and the flow dead-ended before accounts
  - [x] From `pi_requested` onward every step (PI upload → Plant Accounts FA → Global Accounts PO → milestone payments → `completed`) is the **same shared code** as RFQ (`resolveFinalVendor` resolves the auction winner via `finalVendorId` + approved invite, and defaults the PI amount to the winning bid)
  - [x] `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` keeps `negotiation → pi_requested` and `sourcing_approved → pi_requested` so legacy/in-flight requests still reach fulfillment; `sourcing_approved`/`buyer_approved` retained for legacy only
- **Files:** `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/components/VendorGrid.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/lib/auctionUtils.ts`, `src/lib/paymentUtils.ts`, `src/lib/docPackageUtils.ts`

### US-070 — Reverse auction: split award across multiple vendors
- **As a** sourcing user, **I want** to close a reverse auction and award line items to **different vendors** in the Final Decision grid (each with a final price), then have **each awarded vendor** run its own PI → terms → PO → payments track **so that** a single request can be fulfilled by multiple suppliers.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done · **Added:** 2026-06-27
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] **Close + award in the Final Decision column:** after **Close Auction Now**, sourcing picks a vendor + enters a final price per line item; a single **Approve Final Decision & Award** button (gated on auction-ended + every line having a vendor + price, `sourcing_head`/`super_admin`) calls `finalizeSplitAward`. The legacy "✓ OK / Select as Final" header + "Approve → buyer" footer are hidden on the auction path
  - [x] **Per-vendor awards:** lines are grouped by vendor (`buildAwardGroups`) into one **award** per winning vendor, stored on its `VendorInvite` (`awarded`, `awardedItemIds`, `awardAmount` incl. item-wise GST, `awardStatus`, per-award `faCodes`/`purchaseOrder`/`paymentMilestones`/`piSubmittedAt`/`tatStoppedAt`)
  - [x] **Entered price = PO amount:** each award's `awardAmount` (Final-Decision net + GST) drives that award's PI default, PO, and milestones
  - [x] **Terms per award:** each award auto-sends its own doc-package on award; the vendor approves on the supplier portal (`AuctionWinnerTerms`) before sourcing can **Request PI** for that award (restricted to `sourcing_head`/`super_admin`)
  - [x] **Independent fulfillment:** each award progresses on its own (`requestProformaInvoice`/`submitProformaInvoice`/`submitFaCodes`/`issuePurchaseOrder`/`markPaymentMade` take an optional `inviteId`); the supplier sees only its `awardedItemIds` + own PI/PO/payments; `AccountsPanel` renders one `AccountsTrack` per award; `/accounts/queue` shows one row per award; TAT is per award
  - [x] **Request status stays coarse:** award-based requests sit at `pi_requested` until **all** awards are `completed` (`deriveRequestStatus`); `ALLOWED_TRANSITIONS` adds `pi_requested → completed`; a "{n}/{m} awards complete" chip shows on the request. RFQ / single-vendor flows keep the request-level chain unchanged (coexistence via `isAwardBased`)
- **Files:** `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/paymentUtils.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/components/VendorGrid.tsx`, `src/components/AccountsPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/accounts/queue/page.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`

### US-071 — Docs-before-price, FA-code email, and budget-display removal
- **As a** sourcing/accounts user, **I want** vendors to accept the contract documents before pricing, a notification email after FA-code assignment, and the estimate-budget clutter removed, **so that** terms are locked before quotes, asset codes are communicated, and the UI is cleaner.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done · **Added:** 2026-06-28
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] **Docs before price (RFQ):** an RFQ vendor receives the doc-package on invite (`inviteVendors` / `setSourcingMode('rfq')` build `docApprovalPackage`, `docApprovalStatus:'pending'`) and must **Accept** it on the supplier portal (`docsBlocked` gate → `DocPackageReview`) **before** the quotation form unlocks; declining locks it with a "Terms Declined" state. `canRequestPi` unchanged (docs already approved by PI time)
  - [x] **Docs before price (auction):** unchanged — vendors approve the pre-bid Business Rules (PBG + DLC) before bidding; the **redundant post-award terms step was removed** (`finalizeSplitAward` no longer sends a doc-package; awarded vendors see "You won — awaiting PI request" and Request PI is available immediately)
  - [x] **FA-code email:** **Submit FA codes** opens `FaEmailModal` — a preview of a one-time notification email (To `FA_CODE_RECIPIENT_EMAIL`, editable; Subject; Body listing the ordered items + FA codes) — and **Send** fires a toast then `submitFaCodes` (simulated; no backend). One email per FA submission (per award on split auctions)
  - [x] **Budget display removed** from the requests list, dashboard recent-requests, and request-detail line-items tables + the detail meta strip; the **"Est. Budget (Total, ₹)"** input removed from `/capex/new`. The `budget` **data** is retained (savings, KPIs, PO/threshold/`resolveFinalVendor` fallbacks); Brown Field line budget now defaults to the master allocation
- **Files:** `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/lib/constants.ts`, `src/components/FaEmailModal.tsx`, `src/components/AccountsPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/requests/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/dashboard/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/new/page.tsx`

### US-063 — Adhoc head→head budget reallocation
- **As a** sourcing user or plant head, **I want** to move budget from a head with spare to an over-budget head (same plant + FY), with admin approval **so that** overruns can be covered mid-FY.
- **Priority:** must · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] `/capex/adhoc-budget` shows per-head allocation/used/spare and raises an `AdhocBudgetRequest`
  - [x] Admin is the **sole** approver (on `/capex/budget-approvals`); approval writes per-head allocation overrides
  - [x] Master Brown Field head allocations prefer the override; the transfer is the only permitted mid-FY change
- **Files:** `src/lib/adhocBudgetUtils.ts`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/adhoc-budget/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/budget-approvals/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/master/page.tsx`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`

### US-056 — Green Field budget hierarchy (plant → section → head → sub-particular)

- **As a** sourcing admin / plant head
- **I want** to assign an overall plant budget at Green Field plant creation, distribute envelopes to sections, then distribute each section budget to heads and track sub-particular prices against each head budget
- **So that** new-plant capex planning shows clear over/under budget status at every level
- **Priority:** must
- **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] **Create Green Field Plant** modal requires **Overall Plant Budget (Cr)** scoped to FY + business category + plant
  - [x] First time a Green Field section (`Plant Machinery`, `Utilities`, `Compliances`, `Information Technology`) is opened, a modal prompts **Assign Section Budget** before showing heads
  - [x] **Edit Section Budget** action available on Green Field section detail
  - [x] First time a Green Field head (e.g. Moulding Shop) is opened, a modal prompts **Assign Head Budget** before the sub-particular table
  - [x] **Edit Head Budget** action available on Green Field head detail
  - [x] Section budgets deduct from plant budget; head budgets deduct from section budget
  - [x] Sub-particular master rows (`CapexMasterItem.totalCost`) deduct from head allocated budget; green remaining / red over indicators (warning-only, no hard block)
  - [x] Plant grid cards, section cards, and head cards show allocated vs used with over/under status
  - [x] Plant, section, and head detail banners summarise budget envelope, distribution, and remaining
  - [x] Green Field new-request section/head pickers show allocated budget and remaining/over status
  - [x] Brown Field, Digitisation, and IT flows unchanged
  - [x] `greenFieldBudgetAllocations` persisted in `capex_data_v2`; cloned with FY clone
- **Notes / related files:** `src/lib/types.ts` (`GreenFieldPlantBudget`, `GreenFieldSectionBudget`, `GreenFieldHeadBudget`), `src/lib/greenFieldConstants.ts` (budget helpers), `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/master/page.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/new/page.tsx`

### US-055 — Buyer vendor quotes at request creation

- **As a** buyer
- **I want** to add multiple vendor quotes while creating a CAPEX request (vendor, line item, expected total, extras, attachment)
- **So that** sourcing starts with benchmark quotes already in the comparison grid
- **Priority:** must
- **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Main line grid removes **Est. Budget**, **Document**, and **Preferred Vendor** columns — those fields live in per-line quote cards only
  - [x] Each line item shows a collapsed **Vendor Quotes** area directly below the row with **Add Quote** (expand/collapse)
  - [x] Each quote card captures vendor, est. budget (total for qty), document, Transportation/Freight, Service/Installation, Packing/Forwarding, Delivery Lead Time (Weeks), Warranty (Years), and Currency
  - [x] At least one complete quote is **required per line item** before Review/Submit
  - [x] Each quote shows green/red allocation status against the linked master budget for that line
  - [x] Line item budget and request total derive from the **lowest quote amount** per line on submit
  - [x] Same vendor across multiple lines groups into one `VendorInvite` with multi-line `itemPrices` on submit
  - [x] Seeded quotes appear in sourcing `VendorGrid` with status quote received and “Added at request” badge; visible to buyer, plant head, and sourcing on request detail
  - [x] Review step shows each line item with its quote cards grouped underneath
- **Notes / related files:** `src/lib/requestQuoteUtils.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts` (`Quote.seededByBuyer`), `src/app/(internal)/capex/new/page.tsx`, `src/components/VendorGrid.tsx`

### US-053 — Green Field master sections (Plant Machinery, Utilities, Compliances, IT)

- **As a** sourcing admin / plant head
- **I want** Green Field CAPEX Master to use section cards after site creation, with predefined shop and utility child heads
- **So that** new-plant budgets follow the Green Field taxonomy while Brown Field stays flat
- **Priority:** must
- **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Green Field master detail: plant → four section cards (`Plant Machinery`, `Utilities`, `Compliances`, `Information Technology`) even when a section has zero rows

- **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] `FieldType` extended: `digitisation`, `information_technology`; `projectType` on requests and master (Brown + Green)

### US-068 — Compact UI pass + responsive vendor portal (desktop table / mobile)
- **As** any user, **I want** a sleeker, more compact, consistent portal; **as a** vendor **I want** the link screen to work well on both my phone and a desktop, with the desktop showing my pricing as a table like the sourcing team sees.
- **Priority:** should · **Status:** done
- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] Portal-wide **compact density** applied consistently via `src/lib/uiTokens.ts` (page `p-5`, section `space-y-4`, cards `bg-card rounded-xl border-border shadow-sm p-4`, **data rows `py-2`**, page titles `text-xl`); editable input-grid cells stay `py-3`/`py-0.5` by design (`TD_CELL_INPUT`). No overlap; touch targets ≥44px.
  - [x] **Aggressive space utilization (v2):** key-value metadata rendered as a dense inline `label: value` strip (not stacked cells) on the request-detail `RequestInfoCard` and vendors expanded row; long text fields use `ClampText` (visible, clamped to 2 lines, measured "Show more/less"); status stepper + dashboard KPIs tightened. Fixes the wasted-space / scroll complaint on `capex/[id]`.
  - [x] **Login responsive** — marketing hero hidden below `lg`, card `w-full max-w-md`, tighter small-screen padding.
  - [x] **Vendor portal: two explicit UIs.** Pricing screens render a **desktop table** mirroring the sourcing grid (`SupplierQuoteTable`, navy header, line items as rows) and a **mobile card stack** (`SupplierQuoteCards`); both share a `read`/`entry`/`bid` variant API and compute GST/totals through `rfqUtils` so they never diverge.
  - [x] **All read surfaces** (under-review, counter, agreed, approved, rejected) use the line-item-aware summary (correct item-wise GST), not a GST-less lump-sum card; reverse-auction threshold surfaced once (whole-quote), not per line.
  - [x] **All non-pricing states** (auction-approval, closed, invalid, PI upload, fulfillment/PO/payments, INCO gate) unified on `SUPPLIER_CARD` with mobile-stacking action rows.
  - [x] Fixed a latent bug: `/accounts/queue` now renders for `plant_accounts` (render guard previously excluded it → blank screen).
- **Notes / related files:** `src/lib/uiTokens.ts`, `src/components/supplier/SupplierQuoteTable.tsx`, `src/components/supplier/SupplierQuoteCards.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/components/DocPackageReview.tsx`, `src/app/login/page.tsx`, all `src/app/(internal)/**/page.tsx`. Built/reviewed via frontend-engineer + ux-tester + quality-challenger.

## Epic: Workflow overhaul (2026-07)

| ID | Story | Status |
|----|-------|--------|
| US-064 | As a budget author, I want my budget to route **plant head → super admin → global accounts** before it goes live, so it's properly approved. | done |
| US-065 | As a super admin, I want to **approve, reject, or send a budget back for correction** with a remark, so the author can fix and resubmit (restarting from the plant head). | done |
| US-066 | As a plant head with no portal login, I want to **approve/reject budgets and requests from an emailed link**, so I don't need an account. | done |
| US-067 | As any internal user, I want to **preview the approval email and copy its link**, so I can see the email + URL layout (demo). | done |
| US-068 | As a requester, I want all field types **except Green Field** to need plant-head approval before sourcing. | done |
| US-069 | As sourcing, I want approving a vendor (RFQ or auction) to go **straight to the vendor's PI upload** with no head gate. | done |
| US-070 | As sourcing, I want starting a reverse auction to **cut the best price 5%** and **reset ranks** until vendors re-bid. | done |
| US-071 | As sourcing, I want to **require an item trial** before awarding; the vendor uploads a video/photo/report after the advance, I approve/reject (loop), and the **final payment is blocked** until approved. | done |
| US-072 | As global accounts ("Sandeep"), I want a **public emailed PO link** (`/po/[token]`) to **upload PO docs and issue the PO** (no login); then the **vendor re-uploads the PI**, **Accounts pays milestones**, and if a **trial** is required it runs after the advance (final payment gated). | done |
| US-073 | As plant accounts, I want the **final-payment date computed** from the supplier's delivery lead time (days) starting at the advance tick. | done |
| US-074 | As sourcing, I want **foreign vendors** to accept Incoterms before quoting, and to see **INR values with the original foreign amount below**. | done |
| US-075 | As anyone, I want the **currency I pick to actually change the displayed currency/amount** (bug fix). | done |
| US-076 | As the vendor, after the PO is issued I want to **re-upload the PI** against it. | done |
| US-077 | As a super admin, I want to **edit the budget line items** (not just write a remark) when sending it back, so the author sees my corrections. | done |
| US-078 | As a plant head, I want the **same edit + send-back-for-correction** ability on my approval link, not just approve/reject. | done |
| US-079 | As the budget-upload user (maintenance), I want my **Requests screen to show my budget approval requests** (status + corrections), not the item requests. | done |

| US-080 | As an approver (plant head, admin, Global Accounts), I want the budget approval screens to show **every sub particular** under its head — not a Live-vs-Proposed delta — so I approve on full visibility. | done |
| US-081 | As a plant user raising a request, I don't want to retype a **Subject** — the **Sub Particular** I pick from the master *is* the item name, and it carries through to the plant head, sourcing, and admin. | done |

| US-082 | As a foreign supplier, I want to fill in my quotation first and answer the INCO Terms in a popup when I hit Submit — with the quote only going through once I've answered them. | done |
| US-083 | As sourcing, I want the vendor's submitted INCO Terms visible to me, editable, and sendable back with a note — looping with the vendor until we agree, reject, or accept. | done |

| US-084 | As sourcing, before I finalise a vendor and request the PI, I want the machine's tech spec — including the spec document the vendor gave me — sent to Amber's Technical team for approval. | done |
| US-085 | As the Technical team, I want to review a vendor's machine spec from an emailed link and approve it, send it back with remarks, or reject it — with the award blocked until I approve. | done |

  - [x] The free-text **Subject** column is gone from the `/capex/new` line grid on desktop, tablet, and mobile
  - [x] **Sub Particular** is the required per-row field (asterisk + `aria-required`/`aria-invalid`); `formValid` requires `masterItemId`
  - [x] The line `description` is derived from the selected sub particular (`getRowDescription`, resolved live from `capexMaster`) and clears when the head or sub particular changes
  - [x] `CapexRequest.subject` derives from the first line's sub particular with a head → generic fallback, so it is never blank downstream (requests list, detail, plant-head link, sourcing, accounts queue)
  - [x] Table `colSpan` maths, sr-only caption, and validation helper text updated for the removed column
- **Notes / related files:** `src/components/BudgetProposalBreakdown.tsx`, `src/lib/budgetProposalUtils.ts`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/{budget-approvals,budget-proposals,new}/page.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/approve/[token]/page.tsx`. Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and a runtime pass on `/capex/new` (Brown Field + Green Field grids, submit → `pending_head_approval` with subject derived from the sub particular).


### US-082 / US-083 — INCO Terms with the quotation (2026-07-20)

- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] The Incoterms questionnaire no longer gates the quote form; a foreign vendor prices their lines and clicks **Submit Quotation**
  - [x] A modal (`IncoTermsModal`) presents the 12 questions; **Submit Terms & Quotation** is disabled until every required answer is filled
  - [x] Quote + terms persist in **one** `proposeRfqQuote(..., incoDoc)` state pass (`rfqStatus` and `incoTermsStatus` both → `pending_sourcing`); closing the modal leaves the quotation unsent
  - [x] The invariant is enforced in the context, not the UI: `proposeRfqQuote` returns false (persisting nothing) on a missing/incomplete/not-applicable `incoDoc`
  - [x] Sourcing sees the answers in the RFQ panel's INCO tracker — viewable at every status, editable on their turn — and can **Approve**, **Edit & send back** (with a `revisionNote` to the vendor), or **Reject**
  - [x] The vendor sees the revision inline (`IncoTermsNegotiationCard`) alongside their quotation and can **Accept**, **Send Back Corrections**, or **Decline**; the loop repeats until approved
  - [x] An unsettled agreement blocks the **award**: `incoTermsBlocksAward` folded into `canRequestPi`
  - [x] Fixed a pre-existing **Rules of Hooks** violation in the supplier portal (a `useCapex()` called after two early returns)
- **Notes / related files:** `src/lib/incoTermsUtils.ts`, `src/lib/rfqUtils.ts`, `src/lib/capexContext.tsx` (`proposeRfqQuote`), `src/app/(public)/supplier/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`. Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and a full runtime pass of the loop (submit with terms → sourcing revise + note → vendor counter → sourcing approve) with a clean console.


### US-084 / US-085 — Technical specification approval before award (2026-07-20)

- **Acceptance criteria**
  - [x] A new step sits between sourcing's Final Decision and the award/PI request; it is **per vendor** (different vendors, different machines — fits split awards)
  - [x] Sourcing uploads the **spec document(s) provided by the vendor** (≤6 files × 2 MB, flagged `From vendor`) plus notes, in `TechSpecPanel` above the Final-Decision bar in BOTH the RFQ and auction views
  - [x] The Technical team reviews on a **public tokenised page** `/tech-spec/[token]` (no login) showing the request, vendor, line-item specs, sourcing's notes and downloadable documents — with copy-link + email preview on the sourcing side
  - [x] They can **Approve**, **Send Back for Revision**, or **Reject**; a remark is required for the latter two, and it surfaces to sourcing
  - [x] Sourcing revises and re-sends — the token is **rotated** and the previous decision stamps cleared; the loop repeats until approved
  - [x] The token is **burned on decision**, so a stale link cannot re-decide; `decideTechSpec` is turn-guarded to `pending_technical`
  - [x] The award is **blocked** until the spec is approved — enforced in `awardAndRequestPi`, `finalizeSplitAward` and `requestProformaInvoice` (not just the UI), with `FinalDecisionActions` disabling and explaining the block per vendor
  - [x] `sendTechSpecForApproval` takes the pending notes so the save + send land in one state pass (a stale read would otherwise drop them)
  - [x] Fixed a pre-existing **file-blob data-loss bug**: a persist running before IndexedDB hydration overwrote the file map with an empty object, destroying every stored blob (PIs, PO documents, trial uploads, attachments) on reload
- **Notes / related files:** `src/lib/techSpecUtils.ts`, `src/lib/types.ts`, `src/lib/tokenUtils.ts`, `src/lib/constants.ts` (`TECHNICAL_TEAM_EMAIL`), `src/lib/capexContext.tsx`, `src/components/TechSpecPanel.tsx`, `src/components/FinalDecisionActions.tsx`, `src/app/(public)/tech-spec/[token]/page.tsx`, `src/components/RfqPanel.tsx`, `src/app/(internal)/capex/[id]/page.tsx`. Verified via `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, and a full runtime pass (upload → reload-survives → send → send-back with remark → revise + re-send → approve → award unblocks → `pi_requested`).
